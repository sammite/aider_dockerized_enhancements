 Just tell me how to edit the files to make the changes.
 Don't give me back entire files.
 Just show me the edits I need to make.
+this chat is a coding project in conjunction with the tool aider in copy-paste mode.
+The actual driver of the edits is qwen2.5-coder:3b, which is a small and not very powerful model.
+For each prompt following this one.
+- minimize total token response to reduce potential context problems.
+- optimize messages for me to copy paste them in and out of gemini and make the whole experience more lightweight.
+- return code suggestions in the format of a .patch file.
+
+Additionally, we won't use the local model at all- simply return to me a /run command I can give aider 
+that will write the contents of your suggestions into a local file named swap_diff.patch, then run this general command:
+
+
+patch --ignore-whitespace --verbose <TARGET_FILE> swap_diff.patch
+
+The totality of the command you return should be in `markdown` for easy plaintext copy and pasting.
