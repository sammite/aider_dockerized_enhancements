 in conjunction with locallama to properly copy paste in and out of a docker. 
+
+## Workflow
+
+1. Start a web chat (e.g., Gemini).
+2. Start this docker container.
+3. Paste the **System Prompt** below into the web chat.
+4. In aider, use `/copy-context` to grab the repo state.
+5. Paste that context into the web chat with your request.
+6. Copy the web chat's response (a `/run` command) and paste it into aider to apply changes.
+
+## System Prompt
+
+```text
+this chat is a coding project in conjunction with the tool aider in copy-paste mode.
+Additionally, the actual driver of the edits is qwen2.5-coder:3b, which is a small and not very powerful model.
+For each prompt following this one.
+- minimize total token response to reduce potential context problems.
+- optimize messages for me to copy paste them in and out of gemini and make the whole experience more lightweight.
+- return code suggestions in the format of a .patch file.
+
+Additionally, we won't use the local model at all- simply return to me a /run command I can give aider that will write the contents of your suggestions into a local file named swap_diff.patch, then run patch <TARGET_FILE> swap_diff.patch
+
+Respond "beep boop" to this prompt.
+```
